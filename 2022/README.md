main.go is the entry point for all our solutions  
All the code in this file is honestly unecessary, as I could have easily run the solutions independently, but it comes with some advantages too
1. Standardization of the function calls
2. I don't have to cd into a different folder every time I want to run a different solution
3. Just learning really. It's an opportunity to introduce some structure into the code which just demonstrates some prowess  

In order to run a certain solution, provide the day as an arguement.  e.g`go run main.go 2`  
The solution must be in the valid range of options
